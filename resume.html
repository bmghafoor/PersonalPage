    <h2 class="about-me">About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Software Engineer transitioning from a career in Biomedical
      Engineering. I've recently completed a software engineering bootcamp and
      I'm skilled in full-stack development, leveraging APIs to integrate AI
      technology into projects, and database management. My background working
      as a surgical robotics engineer coupled with my software engineering
      training has honed my skills as a proficient problem solver.
